## Hoverable Banner

Inspired in a hoverable effect on the initial page of the [Cylndr website](https://cylndr.com/).
Hovering triggers a word change, from 'CREATIVE' to 'CONNECTED'.
The idea was to further enhance the user interactivity with two animations: first, the removal of the dot and the appearance of other dots, and then the visual effect from connecting the dots.
The connection is used to reinforce the 'CONNECTED' word, so, once the dot array is populated and the user stops the hover, the dots will stop and will be unconnected.

A live version (ported to _p5.js_) can be seen in [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1589068).
