## Particles under force fields With Resultant Force View and Draggable Attractos

Variation of GravitationalForceMultParticlesMultiAttractors, where it is possible to visualize the resultant force vector for each particle.
The Attractors are draggable in this sketch, making it easier to create specific distributions of Attractors and see their influence on the Movers.
